Hi reader,

The level of noise in the internet makes me feel embarrassed and guilty while writing this letter. I couldn't nurse my mind wanting to share this letter with you though.

This year, I've seen people counting deaths to understand what's happening in the world, being proud of saving lives by knowing the "right thing to do", blaming others for being ignorant idiots causing deaths. Each of us got some screens streaming massive amount of information in the speed as fast as we can consume.

While The information we consume is massive in quantity, it's nearly zero in quality. It's still really hard to find or access "knowledge", while drops of "information" is everywhere. Big data substitutes museums, art galleries, cathedrals and libraries, simplifies the complex reality  into metrics everybody can understand and follow via their smartphones. The people of the "overground internet" like maintaining and spreading strong sense of certainty about what the truth is, and it takes great bravery to ask questions.

And here I am, thinking about death, not the numbers of it though, the death itself, my own death, and your own death. What does make us alive? Why are we afraid of death ?
