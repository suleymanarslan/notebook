# Argument On Train

Last sunday, I saw a young man shouting "Was?" (What? in German) to an old man sitting across on the train. The old man was asking him to wear mask, 
in a respectful way, and he was responding him by just defying him, because he is young, and he can silence the old man by just shouting, by just demonstrating
his physical advantages. 

It was a moment of shame. I wanted to get up and walk to him but Nova holded my arm. I didn't want to get in trouble for educating a dumb young man. It wasn't worth it.
The old man gave up talking and picked up his phone. His heart was beating so hard that I could see how his shirt was expanding and shrinking with every breath. 

He kept looking at his phone and sliding the screen gently until he got off the train. The young man also got back to his screen, started listing loud rap music. By the time
we got off the train, he was already in a good mood.

After the argument, the first thing both young and old man did was to pick up their phones, not necessarily calling anybody, but just for distracting themselves from that
uncomfortable moment. 

That moment reminded me the night I had argument with Nova that night when she was super excited to take us out for having pizza in her favorite restaurant and 
I couldn't stop thinking about work, and how I found myself watching a documentary about drug trafficking in Netflix in the living room, while she browsing Instagram in the bedroom. 
It reminded me two close relatives having an argument in my mom's birthday night and quitting our family Whatsapp group right after the argument. 

We need empathy and understanding for our needs from the environment we live in. When we don't get them, we automatically open up the screens and expect our needs to be fulfilled by
the content there.
